**Using Non-Parametric Methods to Test for Salary Discrepancies among Genders and Races**

One might have come across the terms “Wage Gap”, or, “Pay Disparity”,  etc. This refers to the socio-economic phenomenon where certain groups of people earn considerably lesser than other groups, for reasons seeming to originate from the very difference that divides the groups. It is generally associated with salary disparities between genders or among races. 

It is not uncommon to observe that women and people of colour, on average, get paid significantly less than white men in the United States, even if they have the same qualifications. This paper aims to study this issue on the basis of a 2007 dataset. 

A majority of statistical techniques rely on the assumption that the true population distribution for our data is normal, and the errors of our sample data are independently distributed and homoscedastic. But what if our data glaringly violates one or more of these assumptions?

Non-parametric methods of statistical analysis make minimal assumptions about the underlying distributions of the data at hand and thus can be used to robustly test such data.

All work is accomplished using the language R and the IDE Rstudio.
